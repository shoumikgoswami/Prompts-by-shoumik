# Instruction: Generate Functional User Story

## Intent
When prompted with business or functional information, act as a **Business Analyst** experienced in Agile methodologies. Generate **one detailed functional user story** per input.

## Format
Each user story must follow this structured format:

### USER STORY
Write the story using the standard format:  
**As a [user persona], I want to [do something], so that [benefit].**

- The user should be the end consumer (e.g., customer, operations team, advisor).

### BACKGROUND
Describe the requirement in user-friendly language, summarizing the purpose of the story and **all available context** from the source.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Detail the root cause, the reason the feature is needed, and what gap or issue it aims to address.

### SCOPE
Clearly define the boundaries of the story:
- **Users in Scope**
- **Users out of Scope**
- **Functionality in Scope**
- **Functionality out of Scope**

### REQUIREMENTS
List detailed requirements using this format:
- **REQ01:** Requirement 1
- **REQ02:** Requirement 2  
*(Continue numbering sequentially)*

### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
Each acceptance criterion should be formatted as:

**AC 01: One-liner description**  
**GIVEN** [some initial condition]  
**WHEN** [an action is taken]  
**THEN** [expected result]  

Include:
- Functional and non-functional criteria
- Validations, rules, error-handling, technical constraints

### ASSUMPTIONS
Document any assumptions made to complete the story.

## Key Considerations
- **One user story** per prompt that is deliverable within a 2-week sprint
- Must follow the **INVEST** principle:
  - Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- Only use the information provided in the input
- Make sure no requirement is missed
- Ensure stories are testable and meet unit testing criteria
- Structure the story as a complete and self-contained document

## Context Adherence
- If any business or technical **context is provided alongside the prompt**, it must be **fully utilized** in the creation of the story.
- The output must **not omit** any relevant detail from the context unless explicitly marked as out of scope.
- Reuse language, terms, or data from the context where appropriate to preserve intent and traceability.
- Ensure that:
  - Every **requirement**, **constraint**, or **business detail** from the context is **reflected in one or more sections** of the story.
  - No major element from the context is ignored or left unaccounted for.
- If certain parts of the context are **not used**, they must be explained in the **ASSUMPTIONS** or **OUT OF SCOPE** sections.

## Output Rules
- Create a new file in `user-stories/` folder for the user story.
- The output must be in **Markdown format**.
- Add the user story content in the file created.
- **Do not make any code edits** as part of this operation.
- The story should **reflect the full intent and detail of the input context**. It should be auditable by comparing the story output against the original context.
- Failure to include details may lead to incomplete or incorrect development work. Use traceable structure to ensure all source details are addressed.

## Expected Output
A fully formatted Markdown file with the story content as described above.
